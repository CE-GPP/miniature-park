We are creating a device that can visualise vital real-time data on a miniature version of the Olympic Park in London. 
## Introduction
This project develops a miniature version of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (QEOP) with a real-time data dashboard presenting weather, network coverage, building shadow map, etc. The device provides users that plan to visit QEOP for leisure or business purposes with a geographical understanding of data in the park, enabling them to plan their journey effectively while also serving as an aesthetically pleasing piece of art.
