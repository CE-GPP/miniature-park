We are creating a device that can visualise vital real-time data on a miniature version of the Olympic Park in London. 
## What is this?
This project develops a miniature version of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (QEOP) with a real-time data dashboard presenting weather, network coverage, building shadow map, etc. The device provides users that plan to visit QEOP for leisure or business purposes with a geographical understanding of data in the park, enabling them to plan their journey effectively while also serving as an aesthetically pleasing piece of art.

As in the figure below, users can select map layers of the web application to display with a button, and look through the transparent 3D model to see the information.

## What can this help with?
Data dashboards are typically designed by or for experts, focusing on functionality over aesthetics. This can be limiting for general users who seek accessible and appealing ways to access real-time information. Moreover, there is a lack of devices that combine practicality with sophisticated design. This project addresses these gaps by creating a data dashboard that is visually appealing and user-friendly, targeting general users rather than experts.

## Development procedures
- Design and development of a transparent 3D printed model in Blender.
- Creation of a wooden enclosure using laser cutting and wood stain to achieve a classic oak appearance.
- Integration of a 7-inch main display with HDMI support, a 1.9-inch sub-display with a custom UI for a dynamic data feed, and an EC11 rotary encoder for easy control.
- Utilisation of a Raspberry Pi 4 for computing and displaying data, allowing for quick software development using Python and web-based frameworks.
