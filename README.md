# miniature-park
We are creating a device that can visualise vital real-time data on a miniature version of the Olympic Park in London. 
## Introduction
This project develops a miniature version of the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (QEOP) with a real-time data dashboard presenting weather, network coverage, building shadow map, etc. The device provides users that plan to visit QEOP for leisure or business purposes with a geographical understanding of data in the park, enabling them to plan their journey effectively while also serving as an aesthetically pleasing piece of art.

## Procedures
- Design and development of a transparent 3D printed map that provides an intuitive user experience and aesthetic appeal.
- Creation of a wooden enclosure using laser cutting and wood stain to achieve a classic oak appearance.
- Integration of a 7-inch main display with HDMI support, a 1.9-inch sub-display with a custom UI for a dynamic data feed, and an EC11 rotary encoder for easy control.
- Utilisation of a Raspberry Pi 4 for computing and displaying data, allowing for quick software development using Python and web-based frameworks.
